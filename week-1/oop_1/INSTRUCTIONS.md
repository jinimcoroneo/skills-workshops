# Classes 1: Introducing Encapsulation (1h)

## Learning Objectives:

- Define 'behaviour' as 'the things a program does'
- Define 'class' as a 'convenient encapsulation of behaviour'
- Encapsulate behaviour into classes

## Starter (15 minutes)

Build out a rudimentary calculator _without using classes_. An example is available on the `example` branch for this directory.

During this, you should define (and elicit definitions for):

- **Behaviour:** things a program does, largely synonymous with methods in a program.
- **Encapsulation:** a way to wrap and group common behaviour so your program is more organised.
- **Class:** The Object-Oriented way to wrap common behaviour.

## Main (30 minutes)

Students should wrap the bare methods you wrote into a class structure. They can start by cloning this repository.

## Plenary (15 minutes)

Choose two students' examples to share, and critique them. Then either demonstrate your solution, or use the `plenary` branch for this directory.

Below is a set of user stories wrapped into classes for the plenary:
